# COrE_2016_Instrument_Paper-Telescope
Files for the telescope section of the instrument paper for the 2016 COrE proposal. 

images are included, plus:

instrument_master_telescope.tex: 
This is the template provided by the instrument group, just for reference. It calls telescope_bare.tex as an input, which I have not included. It is simply whatever our contribution is with the top matter stripped out.


telescope.tex: 
The current file containing the Gregorian and Dragone sections. I have replaced the top matter that myself and Karl used with that from the master tex file, just to see that it works using only the packages and commands that Jacques etc will use. I have added to this the commands for comments so as we can continue to use them.


aas_macros.sty:
Style file used for the proposal


I have included the references in the format used by the overall proposal. They stick them at the end of the master file, so a bib file isn't necessary (yet!).
